# $\mu$-STAR: a novel framework for spatio-temporal E/MEG source imaging optimized by microstates

This project contains example code for the paper '$\mu$-STAR: a novel framework for spatio-temporal E/MEG source imaging optimized by microstates'.

The 'simulation_erp.m' generates simulation signals, runs the source imaging algorithms, and visualizes the generated and reconstructed sources.
